I did not run into many issues while completing this assignment, although I do not feel very confident in my understanding of bootstrap. Is there a library of class names I can reference to learn the different ways I can manipulate the html objects? For example, I used text-center in this assignment, but could I add change the padding as well? Is this similar to doing in-line css? Other than that, the assignment was straightforward. I didn't use any other resources other than those provided in the assignment document.

Would love some bootstrap cheatsheets or resources. Thanks!
